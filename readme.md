Create an AWS Lambda Function:

Create a Lambda function that will be triggered to send an email when a new file is uploaded to your S3 bucket. You can create this function using the AWS Lambda Console.
Define an S3 Trigger:

Configure an S3 event trigger for your Lambda function. You can specify the S3 bucket and event type (e.g., "ObjectCreated") that should trigger the Lambda function.
Set up SES (Simple Email Service):

If you haven't already, set up AWS SES to send emails. Verify your domain, and create an email address or sender identity.
Write Lambda Function Code:

In your Lambda function code, you'll need to:
    Retrieve the file from S3 when the Lambda function is triggered.
    Read the contents of the file.
    Compose the email using the SES API.
    Send the email with the file contents.

Configure IAM Permissions:

Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to access S3 and SES. You'll need to attach an IAM role to your Lambda function with policies granting the required permissions.
Test and Deploy:

Test your Lambda function to ensure it works correctly. You can upload a sample file to your S3 bucket to trigger the Lambda function and send an email.
Monitoring and Logging:

Set up CloudWatch Logs and monitoring for your Lambda function to track its execution and troubleshoot any issues.
Once configured and tested, your Lambda function will automatically send an email with the contents of the uploaded file whenever a new file is added to your S3 bucket.
